## Assignment 3

This is my repo for **Assignment 3**

### Answer to questions below:


__Questions regarding your understanding of the Topicâ€™s materials.__

*One of the main questions I had in response to the material was the use of width and height. Within the tutorial I percieived it as below:*

```html
width="20"
height="30"
```
- This is creating an html page with a width and height provided?
- If so why does it show the actual width and height text, is this due to it being in the markdown file?

**Summarizing the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.**
