The website idea I have choosen to try and create is the Photography and Art website. 
With this website I want to make a playful tone, trying to create a fun and invitign environment.

In the assignment, I used many methods to help balance my webpages. The one thing I thought of first was how I was going to create a playful theme.
For this I ended up using a beige and mint green color to create a balance of light joyful colors for the webpage. This included making a class so I could envoke this color scheme by wrapping
certain HTML elements in a mint green box. One thing I used was the width and height to align my images together. This includes three images side by side using 33% width, as well as setting the height to all the images to the same value so that it looked more clean and balanced. I also used some break lines to envoke more from the div classes as without it the green box was not full enough.

The design I created was very different from what I originally thought of. In creating this site, finding a specific color theme helped layout many of the elements I wanted to use. Although, I did create a featured art and photos section in which I wanted to originally, many of the other elements were more spontaneous in creation and led to a better result than I had planned. The balance of the website turned out great compared to the colors I originally thought of, with the beige and green contrasting it great, as well as matching the nature theme of the website. 

I did not get the chance to use the floats or margins yet, but will make sure I try to get familiar with it.

One of the main issues I had in creating this website, was trying to figure out how to create descriptions for the art and photos. I realized I probably needed to make a div class, but I did not know exactly how to go about this for formating the text box under the specific image. I tried to create paragraphs under the images aligned to the image location, but this did not end up working at all.
