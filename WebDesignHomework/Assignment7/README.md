Refelction:

What I’m most proud of in this website is the consistent theme I’ve created across each webpage. I believe this will offer users a unique experience, where they become familiar with the same visual style throughout. This consistency should make navigating the website intuitive, as users will recognize the structure and layout, helping them easily find the information they’re looking for.

I ensured that the layout remains uniform on each page, which keeps the navigation simple and avoids confusion. I'm particularly pleased with the contact page. Even though it's simple, I appreciate how it allows users to engage directly with the site, fostering interaction.

Additionally, I’m very satisfied with the way the main elements are spaced on the beige background, which enhances readability and focus. The combination of the spring green title background and the matching green footer provides a nice visual enclosure for the content, giving the pages a cohesive and polished look.
