                    <h2>Kentaro Miura</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kentaro Miura (1966â€“2021) was a legendary manga artist and the creator of the 
                        critically acclaimed dark fantasy series <strong>Berserk</strong>. Born in Chiba, Japan, 
                        Miura began drawing at a young age, demonstrating exceptional artistic talent. His career 
                        skyrocketed with the publication of *Berserk* in 1989, a series that would go on to 
                        influence countless creators and fans worldwide.
