# How To Make The Perfect Coffee (Homepage)

## Tips for Brewing Perfect Coffee

- **Tip 1:** Use fresh coffee beans. This includes using coffee beans right after they have been roasted. Waiting longer than a day will result in the beans being less optimal.

- **Tip 2:** Using a more expensive, better quality coffee will always improve the taste. While this may not be feasible for everyone, you can still make amazing coffee within a budget.

- **Tip 3:** Grind your own coffee beans. The quality starts to diminish almost immediately after grinding, so grinding coffee beans at home will yield better coffee.

- **Tip 4:** Using good quality water will impact the quality of the coffee. Avoid tap water, and opt for purer water to enhance the flavors without the chlorine taste.

- **Tip 5:** Use the correct measurements when making coffee. This includes around 2 tablespoons per 6-ounce cup and 2 and 3/4 tablespoons for 8-ounce cups.

- **Tip 6:** Ensure the correct water temperature when making coffee. The ideal temperature is 200°F. If the water is too hot, it can extract unwanted compounds and diminish flavor.
