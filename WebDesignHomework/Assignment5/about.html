        <h3>Retail Website</h3>

        <p>
            I wanted to create a professional retail website, 
            with sleek looking buttons that tie well with the products.
            I want to create a unique theme, 
            that creates a serious professional tone.

        <h3>Community Board Website</h3>

        <p>
            I wanted to create a positive place for others to share their 
            ideas, and what they think on more joyful topics.

        <h3>Art and Photography website</h3>

        <p>
            For the art website I wanted to create a space 
            for new and old artists to come together 
            and showcase their art.
