        <h1>Retail Website</h1>

        <p>
            One idea for a website is to create a retail website.
            This would include images for products, 
            use of buttons to purchase and for going to other tabs on the website.
            <br />The website tone would be dependent on the product.
            Creating a website for relaxing products 
            such as candles would envoke a calm tone.
            Encorporating repition will also be key to create a calming tone,
            with color decision being a huge factor on establishing the correct tone.

        <h1>Community Board Website</h1>

        <p>
            Another idea is to create a community board 
            for other users to talk on topics of their choosing.
            Users should also be able to create their own accounts
            and create posts for other users to comment on. <br />
            The tone that would fit this type of sit would be a playful
            tone to envoke more friendly and light conversations about topics.

        <h1>Photography and Art Website</h1>

        <p>
            Users should be able to create their own art profiles
            and display their art as a showcase.
            Users should also be able to enter in competitions to
            have the winners art displayed on the homepage.
            This should create a platform for up and coming artists
            to showcase their talent and compete in fun competitions. <br />
            The tone of this website would be a playful tone to 
            encourage fun competition, and a fun website atmosphere.
