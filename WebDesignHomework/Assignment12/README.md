For Sizing, I used it for the photo container to create a perfect size for the photos and art I am using. This helps with making the size not to large so they can be placed next to each other.

This ties into display, using inline-block for the images as well so that they can align side by side.

Within the new elements overflox box, I added padding so that elements had space with the border of the box. 

In regards to the overflow box, I added the overflow elements with text I found online in relation to art, this makes it so if the text is too large it doesnt take up more space, but will allow users to scroll to read the information.

For the art photo container I have a green border to create a better look around images. I already had one from before but changed it a little to make it look better.

I also added margin in some css style elements to also create more space between the elements for better visual clarity and readability.

I also added the relative position elements for the art photo container to try it out with the webpage.
