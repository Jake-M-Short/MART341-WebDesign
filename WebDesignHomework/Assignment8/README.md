For the divs within the html of voting, I created a media section which helps center the media elements including the audio, video and iframe elements. 
For the other div I used an art photo container which works in tandem with my css elements where I made two classes.
These work as one, with one handling the container of the image creating a border as well as specifiying height. The other handling the container of the actual image creating a set width as well as adding a vertial alignment and a display that helps center the images in a row rather than vertically.
This includes the classes with one being the image container for the actual image and the actual container for where the image is placed and its size.
I also created a checkbox within this element called container input giving a checkbox below each image for the user to vote, although not actually functional.

For the escape character, I added it within the bottom part of the webpage with the links to other pages as it seemed to fit correctly here.

Although I wasnt planning on using audio or video within this page. I added a documentay video from youtube that plays photos of the year within nature photgraphy.
I also added a google maps link to yellowstone as inspiration for those who view the page for a great spot for photos.
Lastly, I incorporated an audio file that is calming and can be played while voting for the artwork and photos. This was intentionally placed at the top so users can listen to it while voting rather than enabling it after users have voted.

For the span elements I used a div class called bold text, using the span for the artist and photographers names to make it stand out more to the users.

Overall I learned a lot about stylizing the webpage using these elements, especially with classes jogging my memory of how to use css within html.
