## Project Overview

I created an index.html for the pink panther cartoon.

### Required Techniques

- **External CSS**: Created an external css file for styling of div elements.
- **Class Selector**: Used within div classes for layout of elements such as color for the background, layout of the text as well as the characters profile pictures.
- **ID Selector**: This was applied for each character, identifying the character.

### Additional Techniques

- **Background Colors**: Used Pink and White to create a color theme reminiscent of the cartoon.
- **Font Colors**: Contrasted black and pink, black and white for readibility, 
                    also used some white text within the pink background and pink text on the white background for the theme.
- **Positioning**: Used positioning elements such as `display`, `align`, and `padding` for most of the layout of the site.
- **Border**: Used a border for the character section in pink using `border`, as well as using `border-radius` for the pictures of the character to make it circular.
