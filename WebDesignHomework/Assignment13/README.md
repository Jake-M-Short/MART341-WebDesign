 Tried using chatGPT for creating unique elements. 
 
 This included help with creating nicer character sections, as well as trying to make an image scroll with arrows.
 
  I could not figure out how to fix or make it completely work, but left it in due to it working somewhat. 
  
The main issue I came across was making the first 3 images displayed, but it ended up only doing some images in display, and other images are somewhat shown in other media queries. I could have added javascript but I did not want to over complicate it.
